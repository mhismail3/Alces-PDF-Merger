# Pages base path fix

- Context: Custom domain (`pdf-merger.alces.dev`) showed a blank screen because the site requested assets from `/Alces-PDF-Merger/...`, which do not exist at the domain root.
- Root cause: The deploy workflow forced `VITE_BASE_PATH` to `/${repo}/`, so builds always used the repository subpath even when Pages served from a custom domain root.
- Change: Added `actions/configure-pages@v5` to pull the real Pages base path and feed it into `VITE_BASE_PATH`, then normalized that value in `vite.config.ts` (leading/trailing slash, root fallback). This keeps repo rename support while letting custom domains stay at `/`.
- Validation: `npm run build`.
